# Anaiyzing-Survey-Data

In this program we are analyzing data from a Stack Overflow survey. Jupyter notebooks are being used to analyze each data and to put data in a graphical representation. The pandas package is being used in order to  retrieve  and filter through the data. Also we are using jupyter notebooks Magic to show a graphical representation of the data albeit a pie chart or a bar graph
